# .dockerignore

# 1. Dependencies (Crucial for speed)
# node_modules are installed inside the container, so they are ignored here
node_modules

# 2. Expo Cache and Temporary Files
# .expo contains local cache and configuration specific to your development environment
.expo

# 3. Version Control (Crucial for security and size)
# Git history is not needed inside the running container
.git
.gitignore

# 4. Docker Configuration Files (Not needed in the final image)
# The build and compose instructions themselves are not required for the runtime
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml

# 5. Local Secrets (CRITICAL for security)
# If you use a local environment file, ensure it is NOT copied into the image
